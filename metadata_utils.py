    Reads a CSV file, parsing row values per the provided delimiter. Returns a list of lists,

    WARN: If a byte order mark (BOM) is encountered at the beginning of the first line of decoded
    text, call < read_csv > and pass 'utf-8-sig' as the < encoding > argument.

    WARN: If newline='' is not specified, newlines '\n' or '\r\n' embedded inside quoted fields
    may not be interpreted correctly by the csv.reader.

    Parameters:
        filepath (str): The location of the file to read
        encoding (str): name of encoding used to decode the file
        newline (str): specifies replacement value for newline '\n'
